# Go-Live Checklist for Trae AI Projects

## Executive Summary
This checklist provides a comprehensive framework for transitioning your Trae AI-generated project to a live, production-ready state. The go-live process follows three core principles: **Automation**, **Security**, and **Reliability**.

## Pre-Launch Prerequisites

### ✅ Environmental Setup
- [ ] **Development Environment**: Local workspace configured with Trae AI
- [ ] **Staging Environment**: Netlify preview deployments configured
- [ ] **Production Environment**: Live Netlify site configured
- [ ] **Environment Variables**: All secrets externalized (never hardcoded)
- [ ] **Base44 Configuration**: `.base44rc.production.json` created and validated

### ✅ Repository Setup
- [ ] **GitHub Repository**: Code pushed to GitHub with proper `.gitignore`
- [ ] **Branch Protection**: Main branch protected, requiring PR reviews
- [ ] **Secrets Management**: All production secrets stored in GitHub Secrets
  - [ ] `NETLIFY_AUTH_TOKEN` (fine-grained PAT recommended)
  - [ ] `NETLIFY_SITE_ID` (production site)
  - [ ] `NETLIFY_STAGING_SITE_ID` (staging site)
  - [ ] `DATABASE_URL` (if applicable)
  - [ ] `SECRET_KEY` (application secret)

## Security Checklist

### ✅ The Golden Rule: Never Hardcode Secrets
- [ ] **No API Keys in Code**: All sensitive credentials externalized
- [ ] **Environment Variables**: Using `.env.local` for development (gitignored)
- [ ] **Production Secrets**: Injected at build time via CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] **Client-Side Security**: Sensitive API calls proxied through backend/serverless functions

### ✅ Secrets Management
- [ ] **GitHub Tokens**: Using `GITHUB_TOKEN` for repository operations
- [ ] **Fine-Grained PATs**: For external service authentication (Netlify)
- [ ] **Netlify Secrets**: Production credentials flagged as "write-only" in Netlify
- [ ] **Principle of Least Privilege**: All tokens have minimum required permissions

## CI/CD Pipeline Checklist

### ✅ Continuous Integration (CI) Rules
- [ ] **Rule 4.2.1**: Automated workflows trigger on `push` and `pull_request`
- [ ] **Rule 4.2.2**: Code quality gates implemented (ESLint, Prettier, Flake8)
- [ ] **Rule 4.2.3**: Security scans integrated (Bandit, Safety, Gitleaks)
- [ ] **Rule 4.2.4**: Comprehensive test suite (unit, integration, E2E)

### ✅ Continuous Deployment (CD) Rules
- [ ] **Rule 4.3.1**: Production deploys use `workflow_dispatch` (manual trigger)
- [ ] **Rule 4.3.2**: Dynamic deployment inputs configured (staging/production)
- [ ] **Rule 4.3.3**: Netlify deployment via GitHub Actions

### ✅ Pipeline Stages
1. **Code Quality**: Linting, formatting, style checks
2. **Security Scan**: Vulnerability detection, secret scanning
3. **Automated Testing**: Unit tests, integration tests, coverage reports
4. **Build**: Application compilation and artifact generation
5. **Deploy Staging**: Automatic preview deployments for PRs
6. **Deploy Production**: Manual, controlled production releases
7. **Post-Deploy Validation**: Health checks and smoke tests

## Content Validation & Quality Assurance

### ✅ Code Quality
- [ ] **Static Analysis**: Automated code quality checks in CI
- [ ] **Security Scanning**: Vulnerability and dependency checks
- [ ] **Test Coverage**: Minimum test coverage thresholds met
- [ ] **Documentation**: Code properly documented and commented

### ✅ User Input Validation
- [ ] **Client-Side Validation**: Immediate user feedback implemented
- [ ] **Server-Side Validation**: Secure backend validation (non-bypassable)
- [ ] **Netlify Functions**: Serverless backend for sensitive operations
- [ ] **Data Sanitization**: All user inputs properly sanitized

## Deployment Architecture

### ✅ Multi-Environment Strategy
- [ ] **Local Development**: Trae AI local workspace
- [ ] **Staging**: Netlify preview deployments for testing
- [ ] **Production**: Live Netlify site for end users
- [ ] **Environment Parity**: Staging mirrors production configuration

### ✅ Netlify Configuration
- [ ] **Build Settings**: Correct build command and output directory
- [ ] **Environment Variables**: Production secrets configured
- [ ] **Functions**: Serverless functions for backend operations
- [ ] **Redirects**: Proper URL routing and redirects configured
- [ ] **Headers**: Security headers and CORS policies set

## Go-Live Execution

### ✅ Pre-Launch Validation
- [ ] **Staging Tests**: Full application tested in staging environment
- [ ] **Performance Tests**: Load testing and performance validation
- [ ] **Security Review**: Final security audit completed

### ✅ Launch Process
1. **Final Code Review**: Last-minute code review and approval
2. **Production Deploy**: Manual trigger of production deployment workflow
3. **Health Checks**: Automated post-deploy validation
4. **Smoke Tests**: Basic functionality verification
5. **Monitoring**: Real-time monitoring and alerting active

### ✅ Post-Launch Operations
- [ ] **Monitoring**: Application performance and error tracking
