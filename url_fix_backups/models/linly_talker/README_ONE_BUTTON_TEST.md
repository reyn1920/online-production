        # Try HeyGen first for real-time streaming
        result = await api.generate_heygen_avatar(user_text)
        
        if result['success']:
            return result['video_url']
        
        # Fallback to D-ID for photorealistic
        result = await api.generate_did_avatar(user_text)
        return result.get('result_url')
```

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Issue**: "API key not configured"
```bash
# Solution: Set environment variables
export HEYGEN_API_KEY="your_actual_key"
```

**Issue**: "Generation timeout"
```bash
# Solution: Check internet connection and API status
curl -I https://api.heygen.com/v2/
```

**Issue**: "Demo mode only"
```bash
# Solution: Verify API keys are set
echo $HEYGEN_API_KEY
echo $DID_API_KEY
echo $SYNTHESIA_API_KEY
```

### Getting Help

1. **Check API Status**: Verify the avatar APIs are operational
2. **Review Logs**: Check console output for detailed error messages
3. **Test Connectivity**: Ensure internet connection and firewall settings
4. **Validate Keys**: Confirm API keys are correct and have sufficient credits

## 📈 Performance Optimization

### For Best Results

1. **Text Length**: Keep avatar text under 500 characters for faster generation
2. **API Selection**: Use HeyGen for speed, Synthesia for quality, D-ID for custom faces
3. **Caching**: Cache generated avatars to avoid regenerating identical content
4. **Parallel Processing**: Use multiple APIs simultaneously for redundancy

### Monitoring & Analytics

- Track generation times across platforms
- Monitor API usage and costs
- Measure user engagement with different avatar types
- Set up alerts for API failures or slow performance

## 🌟 Next Steps

After running your one-button test:

1. **Review Results**: Analyze which avatar platforms work best for your use case
2. **Configure Production**: Set up your preferred APIs with proper credentials
3. **Integrate**: Add avatar generation to your main Linly-Talker workflow
4. **Deploy**: Launch your production-ready avatar system
5. **Monitor**: Track performance and user engagement
6. **Scale**: Expand to additional avatar platforms as needed
