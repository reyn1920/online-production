## ðŸŽ‰ Current Status: READY FOR DEPLOYMENT PIPELINE SETUP

**All security and configuration prerequisites are complete!**

The application is now secure and properly configured for production. The next steps involve setting up the deployment infrastructure (CI/CD pipeline, hosting, monitoring) which are external to the codebase itself.

### Key Achievements:
- âœ… Zero hardcoded secrets in codebase
- âœ… Proper environment variable management
- âœ… Production-ready configuration
- âœ… Comprehensive security validation
- âœ… Clean .env.example documentation

### Next Phase:
Implement the CI/CD pipeline and deployment infrastructure as outlined in the deployment preparation section above.
