TASK
Research this topic: AI loop prevention patterns and circuit breaker implementations in modern web applications.
While researching, keep a running register of EVERY web source consulted (opened, loaded, read, referenced, cited, discarded). At the end, output the full register.

OUTPUT FORMAT
1) Executive Summary — ≤100 words.
2) COMPLETE SOURCE REGISTER — Markdown table (one row per source). Columns:
# | Page Title | Canonical Domain | Full URL | Publisher/Author | Content Type | First Seen (UTC) | Last Modified | Date Accessed (UTC) | Why Consulted | Relevance (0–5) | Credibility Notes | Redirect/Duplicate Of | Status

STRICT REQUIREMENTS
- Include ALL consulted sources, even if not quoted or later discarded.
- Expand grouped citations; one source per row; include failed loads with Status.
- Normalize URLs (strip UTM), but keep the actual Full URL you hit.
- If near length limits, continue responses until the register is complete.

VERIFICATION FOOTER
- Total sources consulted: <N>
- Counts by Content Type
- Gaps/limitations (e.g., paywalls)
- Browsing time window (UTC start → end)
