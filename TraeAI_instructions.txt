Run these steps exactly. Do not delete or rename anything. Add-only.

1) Unpack the downloaded archive on my Mac.
2) Run the installer:
   bash "ONLINPRDUCTION_anti_loop_bundle_v1/bundle/scripts/install.sh"

This will:
- Create the canonical directory: ~/ONLINPRDUCTION (if missing)
- Clone my public repo into ~/ONLINPRDUCTION/repo from: https://github.com/reyn1920/online-production.git
- Install the Anti-Loop Kit files (loop_guard, guarded_runner, sitecustomize auto-wrapper)
- Set APP_DIR and ANTI_LOOP_* knobs in .env without overwriting existing keys
- Keep old path aliases working via symlinks
- Make go_live_baremetal.sh honor APP_DIR by default

3) Start the app:
   cd ~/ONLINPRDUCTION/repo
   export APP_DIR="$HOME/ONLINPRDUCTION"
   bash ./go_live_baremetal.sh

4) Verify:
   - Open http://localhost:8000 (API/dashboard)
   - Run ./scripts/anti_loop_watchdog.sh and confirm "all clear"

Loop protection details:
- sitecustomize auto-wraps common agent step functions at runtime (no file edits)
- LoopGuard enforces step/time budgets, duplicate-action suppression, and tool rate limits
- All changes are add-only; no identifiers are renamed; no files are deleted
