# Codebase Quarantine Protocol

## Purpose
This directory contains problematic code that has been quarantined during the re-scaffolding process to prevent contamination of the new clean architecture.

## Quarantine Categories

### 1. Duplicate Files
- Multiple main.py implementations
- Redundant requirements files
- Conflicting configuration files

### 2. Architectural Inconsistencies
- Mixed directory structures (backend/app/src)
- Inconsistent routing patterns
- Fragmented service implementations

### 3. Configuration Chaos
- Multiple .base44rc.* files
- Scattered environment configurations
- Conflicting format standards

### 4. Testing Disarray
- Multiple test directories
- Inconsistent testing frameworks
- Scattered test implementations

## Recovery Process
Files in quarantine can be reviewed and selectively restored once the new architecture is established and proven stable.

## Status: ACTIVE QUARANTINE
Risk Level: HIGH - Current structure prevents reliable deployment
