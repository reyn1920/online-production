# Go-Live Checklist

## Executive Summary

This checklist ensures a secure, reliable, and production-ready deployment following the three core principles: **Automation**, **Security**, and **Reliability**.

## Pre-Launch Security Audit

- [ ] Dependency vulnerabilities are resolved or documented
- [ ] No exposed secrets detected by automated scanning
- [ ] Code coverage meets minimum threshold (>80%)

### ✅ Testing Infrastructure
- [ ] Unit tests pass across all Python versions (3.9, 3.10, 3.11)
- [ ] Integration tests validate service interactions
- [ ] Core module tests verify foundation components
- [ ] Import smoke tests confirm module integrity
- [ ] Performance tests validate acceptable response times

## Environment Configuration

### ✅ Development Environment

## CI/CD Pipeline Verification

### ✅ Continuous Integration (CI)
- [ ] Automated workflows trigger on push and pull requests
- [ ] Code quality gates prevent deployment of failing code
- [ ] Security scans are integrated into the pipeline

## Security Protocols

### ✅ Authentication & Authorization

### ✅ Infrastructure Security
- [ ] HTTPS is enforced for all connections
- [ ] Security headers are configured (CSP, HSTS, etc.)
- [ ] Rate limiting is implemented to prevent abuse
- [ ] Error messages don't expose sensitive information
- [ ] Logging captures security events without exposing secrets

## Performance & Reliability

### ✅ Performance Optimization
- [ ] Static assets are optimized and compressed

### ✅ Reliability Measures
- [ ] Health check endpoints are implemented
- [ ] Graceful error handling is implemented throughout
- [ ] Circuit breakers protect against cascading failures
- [ ] Retry mechanisms are implemented for external services
- [ ] Monitoring and alerting systems are configured

## Content & User Experience

### ✅ Content Validation
- [ ] All user-generated content is validated and sanitized
- [ ] File upload restrictions are properly enforced
- [ ] Content moderation systems are in place if applicable
- [ ] Data export/import functionality is tested
- [ ] Backup and restore procedures are documented

### ✅ User Experience
- [ ] Application is tested across different browsers and devices
- [ ] Accessibility standards are met (WCAG 2.1 AA)
- [ ] Loading states and error messages are user-friendly
- [ ] Mobile responsiveness is verified
- [ ] SEO optimization is implemented

## Final Pre-Launch Steps

### ✅ Documentation
