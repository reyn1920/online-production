  --config ultra_realistic

# View optimization tips
python scripts/generate_realistic_avatar.py --tips
```

### Method 2: Using the Web Interface

1. **Access the Avatar Generator**
   - Open: http://localhost:8000/avatar-generator
   - Or use the paste app: http://localhost:8081

## üìã Step-by-Step Detailed Workflow

### Phase 1: Preparation (2 minutes)

#### 1.1 Source Image Optimization

**‚úÖ Perfect Source Image Checklist:**
- [ ] **Resolution**: 1080p or higher (1920x1080 minimum)
- [ ] **Lighting**: Even, soft lighting on face
- [ ] **Angle**: Direct front-facing or slight 3/4 angle
- [ ] **Expression**: Neutral or slight smile
- [ ] **Background**: Clean, uncluttered
- [ ] **Quality**: Sharp focus, no blur
- [ ] **Format**: JPG or PNG

**üîß Quick Image Enhancement (Free Tools):**
```bash
# Auto-enhance image quality (if needed)
ffmpeg -i input.jpg -vf "eq=brightness=0.1:contrast=1.2" enhanced.jpg

# Resize to optimal dimensions
ffmpeg -i input.jpg -vf "scale=1080:1350" resized.jpg
```

#### 1.2 Script Optimization for Natural Speech

**‚ùå Robotic Script:**
```
Welcome to our presentation. Today we will discuss artificial intelligence. This technology is revolutionary. It will change everything.
```

**‚úÖ Natural, Realistic Script:**
```
Hello there! Welcome to our presentation... So, today we're going to dive into artificial intelligence, which is, you know, absolutely revolutionary... Actually, this technology is going to change everything we know about how we work and live.
```

**üéØ Script Enhancement Rules:**
1. **Add Natural Pauses**: Use "..." for breathing spaces
2. **Include Filler Words**: "so", "well", "actually", "you know"
3. **Vary Sentence Length**: Mix short and long sentences
4. **Use Contractions**: "we're" instead of "we are"
5. **Add Emphasis**: Italics for stressed words

### Phase 2: Generation (3 minutes)

#### 2.1 Configuration Selection

**Available Realistic Presets:**

| Preset | Best For | Key Features |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| `ultra_realistic` | Professional videos | Maximum quality, all enhancements |
| `conversational` | Casual content | Natural pacing, relaxed expressions |
| `professional` | Business presentations | Polished, confident delivery |
| `expressive` | Emotional content | Enhanced facial expressions |

#### 2.2 Advanced Settings (Optional)

```python
# Custom configuration example
from config.linly_talker_realistic import RealisticLinlyConfig

custom_config = RealisticLinlyConfig(
    # Video Quality
    resolution="1920x1080",
    fps=30,
    bitrate="8M",
    
    # Realism Enhancements
    enhance_face=True,
    gfpgan_strength=0.8,
    restoreformer_strength=0.7,
    
    # Natural Movement
    expression_scale=1.2,
    pose_style="natural",
    eye_blink_frequency=0.4,
    
    # Stabilization
    stabilize_video=True,
    smooth_transitions=True,
    
    # Performance
    batch_size=4,
    use_gpu=True
)
```

#### 2.3 Generation Command

```bash
# Full command with all options
python scripts/generate_realistic_avatar.py \
  --image "assets/avatar_source.jpg" \
  --text "$(cat scripts/sample_script.txt)" \
  --config ultra_realistic \
  --output "presentation_avatar_v1"
```

### Phase 3: Post-Processing Polish (2 minutes)

#### 3.1 Automatic Enhancements Applied

Our system automatically applies these camera-like effects:

- **üé¨ Subtle Camera Motion**: Gentle zoom and pan
- **üí° Lighting Simulation**: Soft shadows and highlights
- **üé® Color Grading**: Professional color correction
- **üîä Audio Enhancement**: Room tone and ambient sound
- **‚ö° Stabilization**: Smooth, professional movement

#### 3.2 Manual Polish (Optional)

```bash
# Add background music (optional)
ffmpeg -i avatar_output.mp4 -i background_music.mp3 \
  -filter_complex "[1:a]volume=0.1[bg];[0:a][bg]amix=inputs=2" \
  -c:v copy final_output.mp4

# Add subtle vignette effect
ffmpeg -i avatar_output.mp4 \
  -vf "vignette=angle=PI/4:x0=w/2:y0=h/2" \
  polished_output.mp4
```

## üîß Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Issue: "Robotic" or Unnatural Movement

**Solution:**
```python
# Increase expression and movement settings
config.expression_scale = 1.5  # More facial expression
config.pose_style = "dynamic"  # More head movement
config.eye_blink_frequency = 0.6  # More natural blinking
```

### Issue: Poor Lip-Sync Quality

**Solution:**
```python
# Enhance lip-sync precision
config.lip_sync_strength = 1.0  # Maximum accuracy
config.mouth_enhancement = True  # Better mouth detail
config.audio_preprocessing = True  # Clean audio input
```

### Issue: Low Video Quality

**Solution:**
```python
# Maximize quality settings
config.resolution = "1920x1080"
config.bitrate = "10M"
config.enhance_face = True
config.gfpgan_strength = 0.9
```

### Issue: Slow Generation Speed

**Solution:**
```python
# Optimize for speed while maintaining quality
config.batch_size = 8  # Process more frames at once
config.use_gpu = True  # Enable GPU acceleration
config.fast_mode = True  # Speed optimizations
```
