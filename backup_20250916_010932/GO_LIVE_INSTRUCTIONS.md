# üöÄ Go-Live Instructions

## Production Deployment Checklist

Your application is now equipped with a comprehensive go-live strategy following enterprise-grade best practices. This document provides the final steps to deploy your application to production.

## ‚úÖ What's Already Implemented

### 1. CI/CD Pipeline
- **GitHub Actions Workflow**: <mcfile name="ci-cd.yml" path=".github/workflows/ci-cd.yml"></mcfile>
  - Automated code quality checks (linting, formatting)
  - Security scanning (CodeQL, Semgrep, Bandit, Safety)
  - Automated testing suite
  - Staging and production deployment automation

### 2. Security Infrastructure
- **Content Validation System**: <mcfile name="content_validator.py" path="backend/security/content_validator.py"></mcfile>
- **Production Health Monitoring**: <mcfile name="production_health.py" path="backend/routers/production_health.py"></mcfile>
- **Secrets Management**: Environment variables externalized from codebase

### 3. Deployment Automation
- **Production Deployment Script**: <mcfile name="deploy_production.py" path="scripts/deploy_production.py"></mcfile>
- **Go-Live Validation**: <mcfile name="go_live_checklist.py" path="scripts/go_live_checklist.py"></mcfile>
- **Netlify Configuration**: <mcfile name="netlify.toml" path="netlify.toml"></mcfile>

## üîß Final Setup Steps

### Step 1: Configure Environment Variables

Set up the required environment variables in your deployment environment:

```bash
# Required for deployment
export NETLIFY_AUTH_TOKEN="your_netlify_auth_token"
export NETLIFY_SITE_ID="your_netlify_site_id"
export ENVIRONMENT="production"
export NODE_ENV="production"

# Additional production variables (see .env.production for full list)
export DATABASE_URL="your_production_database_url"
export API_BASE_URL="https://your-domain.com/api"
export ALLOWED_ORIGINS="https://your-domain.com"
```

**How to get Netlify credentials:**
1. Log in to [Netlify](https://netlify.com)
2. Go to User Settings ‚Üí Applications ‚Üí Personal Access Tokens
3. Generate a new token with deployment permissions
4. Create a new site or use existing site ID from Site Settings

### Step 2: GitHub Secrets Configuration

Add these secrets to your GitHub repository:

1. Go to your GitHub repository
2. Navigate to Settings ‚Üí Secrets and variables ‚Üí Actions
3. Add the following repository secrets:
   - `NETLIFY_AUTH_TOKEN`: Your Netlify personal access token
   - `NETLIFY_SITE_ID`: Your Netlify site ID
   - Any other production environment variables

### Step 3: Branch Management

Ensure you're working with the correct branch structure:

```bash
# If currently on 'master', rename to 'main' (recommended)
git branch -m master main
git push -u origin main

# Or work with existing 'master' branch
# Update .github/workflows/ci-cd.yml to use 'master' instead of 'main'
```

### Step 4: Commit and Push Changes

```bash
# Add all go-live infrastructure files
git add .
git commit -m "feat: implement comprehensive go-live strategy

- Add GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline with security scanning
- Implement production health monitoring
- Add content validation and security measures
- Configure Netlify deployment automation
- Add go-live validation checklist"

git push origin main  # or master
```

## üöÄ Deployment Process

### Option 1: Automated GitHub Actions Deployment

1. **Trigger Production Deployment**:
   - Go to your GitHub repository
   - Navigate to Actions tab
   - Select "CI/CD Pipeline" workflow
   - Click "Run workflow"
   - Select `production` environment
   - Click "Run workflow"

2. **Monitor Deployment**:
   - Watch the workflow progress in GitHub Actions
   - All security scans must pass
   - Automated tests must pass
   - Health checks will verify deployment success

### Option 2: Manual Deployment Script

```bash
# Run pre-deployment validation
python3 scripts/go_live_checklist.py

# If validation passes, deploy to production
python3 scripts/deploy_production.py --confirm-production
```

### Option 3: Direct Netlify CLI Deployment

```bash
# Install Netlify CLI
npm install -g netlify-cli

# Login to Netlify
netlify login

# Build and deploy
npm run build
netlify deploy --prod --dir=dist
```

## üîç Post-Deployment Verification

### 1. Health Check Endpoints

Once deployed, verify these endpoints are working:

- `https://your-domain.com/health` - Basic health check
- `https://your-domain.com/health/ready` - Readiness probe
- `https://your-domain.com/health/live` - Liveness probe
- `https://your-domain.com/metrics` - System metrics

### 2. Security Verification

- SSL certificate is active and valid
- Security headers are properly configured
- Content Security Policy is enforced
- No sensitive data exposed in client-side code

### 3. Performance Monitoring

- Page load times are acceptable
- API response times are within limits
- Error rates are minimal
- Resource usage is optimal

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Best Practices Implemented

### ‚úÖ Secrets Management
- No hardcoded credentials in source code
- Environment variables used for all sensitive data
- GitHub and Netlify secrets properly configured
- `.env` files excluded from version control

### ‚úÖ Content Security
- Input validation for all user data
- XSS protection implemented
- SQL injection prevention
- File upload security measures

### ‚úÖ Infrastructure Security
- HTTPS enforced
- Security headers configured
- CORS properly configured
- Rate limiting implemented

## üìä Monitoring and Maintenance

### Continuous Monitoring
- Health endpoints provide real-time status
- Error tracking and logging configured
- Performance metrics collection
- Security scanning in CI/CD pipeline

### Regular Maintenance
- Dependency updates via Dependabot
- Security patches applied automatically
- Performance optimization based on metrics
- Regular security audits

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Environment Variables Not Set**
   - Verify all required variables are configured
   - Check GitHub secrets and Netlify environment settings

2. **Build Failures**
   - Check GitHub Actions logs for specific errors
   - Verify all dependencies are properly installed
   - Ensure build scripts are correctly configured

3. **Deployment Failures**
   - Verify Netlify authentication and site ID
   - Check network connectivity and permissions
   - Review deployment logs for specific errors

4. **Health Check Failures**
   - Verify backend services are running
   - Check database connectivity
   - Review application logs for errors
