# Production Security Checklist

## üîí Critical Security Issues Identified and Fixed

### ‚úÖ CORS Configuration
- **Issue**: Multiple CORS middleware configurations with `allow_origins=["*"]` and `allow_credentials=True`
- **Risk**: Allows any domain to make authenticated requests, potential for CSRF attacks
- **Fix**: Created `config/security.py` with environment-based CORS configuration
- **Status**: RESOLVED

### ‚úÖ Environment Separation
- **Issue**: No clear separation between development and production configurations
- **Risk**: Production secrets could be exposed or development settings used in production
- **Fix**: Implemented `SecurityConfig` class with environment-based settings
- **Status**: RESOLVED

### ‚úÖ Middleware Consolidation
- **Issue**: Duplicate and conflicting middleware configurations throughout main.py
- **Risk**: Inconsistent security policies, potential bypasses
- **Fix**: Created centralized `config/middleware.py` with proper middleware stack
- **Status**: RESOLVED

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Configuration Requirements

### Production Environment Variables (REQUIRED)
```bash
# CRITICAL: Set these in your deployment platform
ENVIRONMENT=production
ALLOWED_ORIGINS=https://yourdomain.com,https://www.yourdomain.com
TRUSTED_HOSTS=yourdomain.com,www.yourdomain.com
RATE_LIMIT_RPM=120

# API Keys (use secrets management)
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_production_key
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_production_key
JWT_SECRET=your_strong_jwt_secret
SECRET_KEY=your_app_secret_key
```

### Security Headers Applied
- `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`
- `X-Frame-Options: DENY`
- `X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block`
- `Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin`
- `Permissions-Policy: geolocation=(), camera=(), microphone=(), payment=()`
- `Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains` (production only)

### Rate Limiting
- Default: 120 requests per minute per IP
- Exempt paths: `/health`, `/metrics`, `/api/version`, `/api/system/status`
- Returns 429 status with Retry-After header when exceeded

## üö® Pre-Deployment Security Checklist

### Environment Configuration
- [ ] `ENVIRONMENT=production` set in deployment platform
- [ ] `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` contains only your actual domains (NO wildcards)
- [ ] `TRUSTED_HOSTS` contains only your actual domains
- [ ] All API keys stored as secrets in deployment platform
- [ ] No hardcoded secrets in codebase
- [ ] `.env.local` files excluded from version control

### CORS Security
- [ ] No `allow_origins=["*"]` in production
- [ ] `allow_credentials=True` only with specific origins
- [ ] Allowed methods limited to what's actually needed
- [ ] Allowed headers restricted to necessary ones

### Middleware Stack
- [ ] GZip compression enabled
- [ ] Trusted host middleware configured
- [ ] Security headers middleware active
- [ ] Rate limiting enabled
- [ ] Request ID tracking implemented
- [ ] No-cache headers for API endpoints

### Secrets Management
- [ ] All secrets stored in deployment platform (Netlify, etc.)
- [ ] No secrets in environment files committed to git
- [ ] Secrets have appropriate access controls
- [ ] Regular secret rotation schedule established

## üîç Security Validation Commands

### Test CORS Configuration
```bash
# Should REJECT requests from unauthorized origins
curl -H "Origin: https://malicious-site.com" \
     -H "Access-Control-Request-Method: POST" \
     -H "Access-Control-Request-Headers: Content-Type" \
     -X OPTIONS https://your-domain.com/api/endpoint
```

### Test Rate Limiting
```bash
# Should return 429 after exceeding limit
for i in {1..130}; do
  curl -w "%{http_code}\n" -o /dev/null -s https://your-domain.com/api/test
done
```

### Test Security Headers
```bash
# Should return all security headers
curl -I https://your-domain.com/
```

## üöÄ Deployment Security Steps

1. **Pre-deployment**
   - Run security audit: `npm audit --audit-level=moderate`
   - Scan for secrets: Use Gitleaks or similar
   - Validate configuration: Check all environment variables

2. **During deployment**
   - Use GitHub Actions with secrets management
   - Deploy to staging first for validation
   - Run automated security tests

3. **Post-deployment**
   - Verify CORS configuration
   - Test rate limiting
   - Confirm security headers
   - Monitor for security alerts

## üìã Ongoing Security Maintenance

### Weekly
- [ ] Review access logs for suspicious activity
- [ ] Check for new security advisories
- [ ] Verify rate limiting effectiveness

### Monthly
- [ ] Rotate API keys and secrets
- [ ] Update dependencies with security patches
- [ ] Review and update CORS origins if needed
- [ ] Audit user access and permissions

### Quarterly
- [ ] Full security audit and penetration testing
- [ ] Review and update security policies
- [ ] Update incident response procedures
- [ ] Security training for team members

## üÜò Security Incident Response

1. **Immediate Actions**
   - Identify and isolate affected systems
   - Revoke compromised credentials immediately
   - Enable additional logging and monitoring

2. **Investigation**
   - Analyze logs for attack vectors
   - Assess scope of potential data exposure
   - Document timeline and impact

3. **Recovery**
   - Apply security patches
   - Rotate all potentially compromised secrets
   - Update security configurations
   - Monitor for continued threats

4. **Post-Incident**
   - Conduct post-mortem analysis
   - Update security procedures
   - Implement additional preventive measures
   - Report to relevant authorities if required

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL REMINDER**: Never deploy to production without:
1. Setting proper `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` (no wildcards)
2. Configuring `TRUSTED_HOSTS` for your domain
3. Storing all secrets in your deployment platform's secrets management
4. Testing the security configuration in staging first
