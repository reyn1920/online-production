(irritated) Oh great, what do you kids want? Can't you see I'm busy?

TEENAGER 1
(sarcastically) Oh, sorry Emily! We didn't realize you were running a high-stress environment here. Can we get some coffee and pastries to go with our chaos?

EMILY
(firmly) Look, I appreciate your business, but I can't have you making a scene in here. It's distracting my other customers.

TEENAGER 2
(smirking) Oh come on, Emily! Lighten up! We're just having some fun. Don't be such a buzzkill.

(firmly) I'm not being a buzzkill, I'm just trying to run a business here. You kids need to respect that.

(as they stand up) Hey Emily, can we come back sometime? We promise to be less rowdy next time!

Her hair is tied back in a messy bun, and her eyes light up with dedication as she works.
The door bursts open, and a group of rowdy teenagers barge in, causing the shop to vibrate with their energy.

Emily sighs in relief as the teenagers leave. She looks around the shop, making sure everything is tidy before starting to clean up after the lunch rush.

EMILY
(to customer) Can I get you something?

ROWDY TEENAGERS
(excitedly) Yo, can we get some drinks? We just want a place to chill!

EMILY
(polite but firm) I'm afraid I can't accommodate your group's needs right now.

ROWDY TEENAGERS
(disappointed) What do you mean? We just want some drinks and a place to hang out!

EMILY
(kindly) I understand, but my coffee shop is not the best fit for large groups. It's too small, and we don't have enough seating or staff to handle big crowds. Plus, other customers might feel uncomfortable with all of you in here at once.

ROWDY TEENAGERS
(whining) But we just want a place to hang out! Can't we just have some drinks and chill?

EMILY
(firmly) I apologize, but my shop is not designed for that kind of activity. You're welcome to come back when it's quieter, though!

ROWDY TEENAGERS
(defeated) Fine... (They mutter and trudge away, looking disgruntled.)

EMILY
(to herself) I just hope they come back when it's less busy... and less rowdy!

MR. GRUMPY

Is everything okay? You seem a bit...grumpy today.

(sighing) Just tired of this place. It's always so busy and noisy here. I just want some peace and quiet.

EMILY
Oh, I understand! We do get pretty busy during rush hours. But we have a lovely atmosphere here, don't you think? And we pride ourselves on providing excellent customer service. Would you like to sit down and have a drink while you wait for your order?

MR. GRUMPY
(hesitating) I...I suppose so.

CUT TO:
As the afternoon wears on, Mr. Grumpy starts to relax and even cracks a small smile as he sips his coffee. Emily notices the change in him and approaches him with a warm smile.

EMILY
(friendly) You know, you're looking much happier now! I'm glad you decided to stay and enjoy your drink.

MR. GRUMPY
(chuckling) Yeah, I guess I needed a little break from my grumpiness. Thanks for the hospitality, Emily.

EMILY
(firmly) I apologize, but we're closed now. Please leave.

DIFFICULT CUSTOMER
(indignant) But I haven't had my drink yet! This is outrageous!

EMILY
(exasperated) I understand that you're upset, but please understand we can't serve you after hours. It's against the law and could result in serious consequences for us. Please leave before things get ugly.

DIFFICULT CUSTOMER
(sputtering) This is ridiculous! How can you just close up on me like this? Don't you care about your customers?

EMILY
(losing patience) I do care, but we have to follow the rules and regulations for the safety of everyone involved. Now please leave before I call security.

EMILY
(collapsing into a chair) Oh my god... (She buries her face in her hands and lets out a deep sigh)

ASSISTANT
(soothingly) Emily, are you okay? That guy was really something else, huh?

EMILY
(shaking her head) Just another day in the life of a small business owner... (She mutters under her breath and shakes her head)
