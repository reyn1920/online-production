{"content": "🔥 Solid choice — let's start fresh with a performance‑focused chat. That way we can stay laser‑focused on:\n\n📊 Measuring throughput & latency (req/sec, p95, p99)\n🧪 Using the benchmark.py we built (asyncio + httpx), or hey CLI\n⚙️ Optimizing FastAPI/Uvicorn (workers, event loop, connection limits)\n🐳 Tweaking Docker/Nginx settings for your MacBook Air M1 (16GB)\n👉 When you begin the new chat, you can kick off with something like:\n\n\"I want to run performance benchmarks on my FastAPI app (MacBook Air M1, 16GB RAM). Show me how to test request throughput and optimize Uvicorn/Nginx config.\"\n\nThat'll get you a clean, focused run at load testing + tuning 🚀.\n\nWould you like me to also prep a baseline performance checklist (like 5 steps to run right away) that you can paste into the new chat and execute directly?", "title": "FastAPI Production Guide - Complete Performance & Infrastructure Playbook", "language": "markdown"}
